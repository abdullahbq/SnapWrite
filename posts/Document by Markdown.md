# My Markdown Document

## Introduction

Welcome to my Markdown document! In this document, we'll cover various topics, including formatting, headers, lists, and more.

## Formatting Text

You can make text *italic* by using single asterisks or underscores, and **bold** with double asterisks or underscores.

## Headers

Headers are created using the hash symbol (#). The number of hashes represents the header level.

### Subheader

Subheaders are created using additional hash symbols.

## Lists

### Ordered List

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

### Unordered List

- Item A
- Item B
- Item C

## Links

You can create [links](https://www.example.com) by placing the link text in square brackets followed by the URL in parentheses.

## Images

![Alt Text](https://placekitten.com/200/300)

## Code

Inline code can be created with backticks, like `const variable = "Hello";`. For code blocks, use triple backticks:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```
